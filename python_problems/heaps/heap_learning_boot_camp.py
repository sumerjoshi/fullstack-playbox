Heap Property - Key at each node is greater than its children.
[Max Heap] can be array where the indices at index i are 2i+1 and 2i+2

Max Heap supports O[n] inserations , O(1) time lookup of max element and deletion of the max element.
Extract Max Operation is defined to delete and return the max element.

Heap is referred to as a priority queue and sometimes (the deletion) removes the highest priority

Each string is processed in O(log k) time, which is the time to add and remove the element from the heap.
