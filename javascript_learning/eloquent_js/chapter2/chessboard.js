/*
Chessboard
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
*/

for(let number = 1; number <= 8; number +=1){
  for(let numbertwo = 1; numbertwo <= 8; numbertwo +=1){
    if(numbertwo % 2 == 1) {
      console.log(" # # # #")
    } else {
      console.log("# # # #")
    }
  }
}
